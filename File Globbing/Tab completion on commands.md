# Tab completion on commands


We are supposed to tab complete a command that starts with pwncollege.



**Flag:** `pwn.college{8mMgPoNtezgYRm-Wi_PFW2A5Zzd.0VN0EzNxwiM0EzNzEzW}`

I enter pwncollege and hit tab which autocompleted the command. Running the command gives me the required flag.

```
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-21762
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8mMgPoNtezgYRm-Wi_PFW2A5Zzd.0VN0EzNxwiM0EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
