# Matching paths with []

Now we're supposed to run the program from the home directory using [] to match the path of the files.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Izpqiy8z6d_7tQqkHwVLcBpVuNa.QX0IDO0wiM0EzNzEzW}`

In this we ran it from the home directory unlike the last challenge.

```
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Izpqiy8z6d_7tQqkHwVLcBpVuNa.QX0IDO0wiM0EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

In this we used file globbing to match the path instead of the file.
