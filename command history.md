# Command History
In this challenge we learn how to access the commands history in the terminal by using the up and down arrows  

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{8AlDF5zAA_8RNjMpU0TCrM3pW1E.0lNzEzNxwiM0EzNzEzW}'

We use the up arrow key to navigate through the commands where the flag was stored.

```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{8AlDF5zAA_8RNjMpU0TCrM3pW1E.0lNzEzNxwiM0EzNzEzW}
