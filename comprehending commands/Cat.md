# Cat
We have to read the flag from a file named flag in the home directory using the cat command.

**Flag:** pwn.college{wtGtm17nzi84WMLMUADo1cSKsfA.QXxcTN0wiM0EzNzEzW}
I just read the flag file from home directory using the cat command. 

```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{wtGtm17nzi84WMLMUADo1cSKsfA.QXxcTN0wiM0EzNzEzW}
```
