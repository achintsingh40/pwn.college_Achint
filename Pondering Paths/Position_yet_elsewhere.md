# Position yet elsewhere

In this challenge we need to first go to the directory specified and then execute the absolute path for the 'run' file from 'challenge' directory  

**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

## What I learned
 In this challenge we learnt how to change direcotry and provide absolute paths. We first wrote  /challenge/run this gave us a error while giving a <path>. we then use cd <path> we got from it adn then provide the /challenge/run
